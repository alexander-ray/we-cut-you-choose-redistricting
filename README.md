# Overview
Lightweight repo to hold the jupyter notebook used for CSCI 5423 course project. 

The notebook includes code for simulation and analysis of a recursive two-player game approach to redistricting, in the context of Wisconsin congressional districts. The game is a variation of the classic ``I cut, you choose'' solution to fair division probelms in which we leverage Gerrychain (gerrychain.readthedocs.io/) to produce a set of partitions which each player can choose from.

# Data
The precinct-level geographic and voter data provided by MGGG (https://github.com/mggg-states/WI-shapefiles) was used for this analysis.
